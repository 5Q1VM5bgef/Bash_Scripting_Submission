# Bash_Scripting_Submission

## What is this?
This is a Repo for submitting your bash script, for the bash scripting challenge posted in the Het_Tanis discord server.

## TL;DR
I will gift someone the book I was recommending **"The UNIX Programming Environment"** by Kernighan and Pike, and ship it to you, to the first person who writes a bash script (sans ChatGPT) that:
* Catches signals
* Has a help/usage statement
* Uses named Exit codes
* Has arg parsing 
* Posts it to this repo here
* and the script of course works

## How do I submit
1. You just need to submit a pull request with your submission.
2. Wait to end of the weekend
3. Profit

```bash
# Create your script
script="<your_script_name_here>"
chmod 0750 ${script}
git commit .
git commit -m 'SUBMISSION: My submission to the bash scripting challenge'
```
